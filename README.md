# Android Developer Nanodegree Program | Popular Movies App
In this stage of assignment, the task was to build the core experience of a movies app.

[Android Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.com](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

The app will:

- Present a grid arrangement of movie posters to the user upon launch
- Provide the ability to change sort order via settings
- Show transition when tapped onto the movie poster, leading the user to a details screen which will display additional information of the movie
- Allow users to view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser)
- Also allow users to mark a movie as favorite in the details screen
- Create a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline)
- Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection

# Project Rubric
The student is required to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. By building this app, they will demonstrate their understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. The app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.
